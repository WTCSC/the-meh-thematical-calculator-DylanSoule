# Dylan Soule's Calculator

This calculator allows you to do basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation  


The use of the calculator is a little bit more difficult than a conventional as you have to deal with our intern, who really doesn't want to be here, but everyone's gotta get job experience somehow  


Now, while this doesn't seem like something you want in a calculator, but hopefully you can laugh at just how much they don't want to be there while getting some productive calculations done

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Does not require any external libraries however the built in time library is used

## Installation
* Download the [calc.py](./calc.py) file  
* Import the file into a code running software such as vscode or you can run in the terminal  
* Run the file

## How to Use
Begin by running the file, run the command below in your terminal if you are doing it there
```bash
cd [file path to calc.py] | python3 calc.py
```
After running the file you will begin to be prompted by our intern, who is really rude, but unfortunately we couldn't find another hire, so you're gonna have to deal with them.  
Once you get to the part where you input what you want to do, input in the form of a [operation] b  
* examples
    * 1 + 2 for addition
    * 2 - 1 for subtraction
    * 3 * 5 for multiplication
    * 9 / 3 for division
    * 2 ^ 5 for exponentiation
 

After one operation, you have the option to either do another one or quit the program


### Warning
* Our intern is quite bad, but we couldn't find another one, so if you do something that they don't what you to, like inputting the operations wrong, the program will end


## Program Flow
* The Program Runs based on specific outcomes defined in the flow chart [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/8ef726de-c988-455c-8699-5203efd89214/edit?viewport_loc=346%2C369%2C3382%2C1804%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_995f578e-e8bd-4870-9d5a-17ef44ae1b5a), or shown below:
