# Dylan Soule's Pet Rock Simulator

This Pet Rock Simulation brings you on an epic journey through pure human experiences and a story one will never forget

During the journey you get to interact with your pet rock, that you get to name, and get to decide what to do  
These decisions will affect key stats and ultimately lead to endings that will change the way you view life

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Does not require any external libraries however the built in time library is used

## Installation
* Download the [calc.py](./calc.py) file  
* Import the file into a code running software such as vscode or you can run in the terminal

## How to Use
Begin by running the file, run the command below in your terminal if you are doing it there
```bash

Once you get to the part where you input what you want to do, input in the form of a [operation] b


### Warning
